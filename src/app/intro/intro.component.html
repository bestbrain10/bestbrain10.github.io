          My name is Livinus Igbaji Oga-ifu, Male, 23 years old, has a B.ENG (Computer Engineering, MOUAU) from Biase Local government area of Cross river state Nigeria.
          I am a backend developer who works primarily with NodeJS and just about any Database that best solves the problem at hand.

          I am always focused on improving myself as a person and as a developer. Currently I am looking to strenghten my DevOps Skill sets.
          To that I have been studying cloud computing platforms and technologies like (AWS and GCP) and other tools such as terraform, ansible and kubernetes.
          Apart from that I love collaborating to solve issues and share ideas. Core to my personal mantra is developing strong emotional intelligence to work with negative feedback and criticism to improve regardless of my environment.
